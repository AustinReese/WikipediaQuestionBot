He later agreed with Columbia Pictures to star in Ghostbusters\u2014in a role originally written for John Belushi\u2014to get financing for The Razor's Edge.

It's easily his best movie.\" That same year he starred in the comedy film, Mad Dog and Glory alongside Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman. Critic Vincent Canby of The New Yorker wrote in his review, \"The great satisfaction of Mad Dog and Glory is watching Mr. De Niro and Mr. Murray play against type with such invigorating ease.\"\n"}

In 2004, he provided the voice of Garfield in Garfield: The Movie, and again in 2006 for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties.
