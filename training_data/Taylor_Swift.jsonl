{"text": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, before releasing her eponymous debut studio album in 2006. \n"}
{"text": "Swift explored country pop on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" as singles on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. She experimented with pop, rock, and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by the singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". With her synth-pop fifth studio album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\", Swift shed her country image and transitioned to pop completely. The subsequent media scrutiny on Swift's personal life influenced her sixth album Reputation (2017), which delved into urban sounds, led by the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n"}
{"text": "Parting ways with Big Machine to sign with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her next studio album, Lover (2019). Inspired by escapism during the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift ventured into indie folk and alternative rock styles on her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore, receiving acclaim for their nuanced storytelling. To gain ownership over the masters of her back catalog, she released the re-recordings Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) in 2021. Besides music, Swift has played supporting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010) and Cats (2019), has released the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), and directed the musical films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\n"}
{"text": "Having sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Eight of her songs have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and her concert tours are some of the highest-grossing in history. She has received 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 34 American Music Awards (the most for an artist), 25 Billboard Music Awards (the most by a woman) and 56 Guinness World Records, among other accolades. She featured on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015) and Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (2019) lists and rankings such as the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Named Woman of the 2010s Decade by Billboard and Artist of the 2010s Decade by the American Music Awards, Swift has been recognized for her influential career and philanthropy, as well as advocacy of artists' rights and women's empowerment in the music industry.\n"}
{"text": "Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, at the Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor. She was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor, and has Scottish and German heritage. Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer. Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s. Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father purchased from one of his clients. Swift identifies as a Christian. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.\n"}
{"text": "At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything.\" She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music. She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke covers. She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"\n"}
{"text": "When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels. After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.\n"}
{"text": "To help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee. Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which could better accommodate her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.\n"}
{"text": "In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14, citing the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\u2019s stuff\" as reasons; she was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists. She recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"\n"}
{"text": "At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004. Becoming one of the first signings Big Machine, she wanted \"the kind of attention that a little [new] label will give,\" and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000. She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after. Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\". She wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia. Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice.\" Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, where it spent 157 weeks\u2014the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.\n"}
{"text": "Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\"; Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio.\" As there were not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so. She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time. Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music. Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\", and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours throughout 2006 and 2007, including George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.\n"}

She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. She opened for the Rascal Flatts on their 2008 summer and fall tour.

Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention, and many Internet memes. James Montgomery of MTV argued that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\". That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album. Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year. The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.

This made Swift the first artist to debut atop both the U.S. singles and albums charts simultaneously, as well as the first to do so twice. Each album sold over one million units worldwide in its first week, with Folklore selling two million. Folklore broke the Guinness World Record for the highest first-day album streams by a female artist on Spotify, and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the U.S., having sold 1.2\u00a0million copies. Swift was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and highest-paid solo musician worldwide. At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time. Folklore won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman in history to win the award three times.\n"}
{"text": "Following the masters controversy, Swift released two re-recordings in 2021, adding \"Taylor's Version\" to their titles. The first, Fearless (Taylor's Version), peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming the first re-recorded album to do so. It was preceded by the three tracks: \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", \"You All Over Me\" with Maren Morris, and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\", the first of which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and the re-recording of a single reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift released \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" on September 17, after the original song gained traction on the online-video sharing app TikTok. The second re-recording Red (Taylor's Version) was released on November 12. Its final track, \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\"\u2014accompanied by All Too Well: The Short Film directed by Swift\u2014debuted at number one on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. She was the highest-paid female musician of 2021, and both her 2020 albums and the re-recordings were ranked among the 10 best-selling albums of the year. In May 2021, Swift was awarded the Global Icon Award by the Brit Awards and the Songwriter Icon Award by the National Music Publishers' Association. \n"}
{"text": "Outside her albums, Swift featured on four songs from 2021\u20132022: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine, a remix of Haim's \"Gasoline\" and Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\". She has been cast in David O. Russell's untitled film, slated for release in November 2022.\n"}
{"text": "One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music, and was introduced to the genre listening to \"the great female country artists\" of the 1990s\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton, the latter of whom she believes is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\", and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna. She has also cited Keith Urban's musical style as an influence.\n"}
{"text": "Swift has also been influenced by various pop and rock artists. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models. Discussing McCartney and Harris, Swift has said, \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind\u00a0[...] He's out there continuing to make his fans so happy. Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.\" She likes Springsteen for being \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older because she admired how Harris prioritized music over fame. Swift says that Kristofferson \"shines in songwriting\", and she praised Simon for being \"emotional\" but \"strong\" at the same time. Her synth-pop album 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and Madonna. As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell, citing especially how Mitchell's autobiographical lyrics convey the deepest emotions: \"She wrote it about her deepest pains and most haunting demons ... I think [Blue] is my favorite because it explores somebody's soul so deeply\".\n"}
{"text": "\"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur.\"\n"}
{"text": "Swift's discography spans country, pop, folk, and alternative genres. Her first three studio albums, Taylor Swift, Fearless and Speak Now are categorized as country; her eclectic fourth studio album, Red, is dubbed both country and pop; her next three albums 1989, Reputation and Lover are labeled pop; and Folklore and Evermore are considered alternative. Music critics have described her songs as synth-pop, country pop, rock, electropop, and indie, amongst others; some songs, especially those on Reputation, incorporate elements of R&B, EDM, hip hop, and trap. The music instruments Swift plays include the piano, banjo, ukulele and various types of guitar. Swift described herself as a country artist until the release of 1989, which she characterized as her first \"sonically cohesive pop album\".\n"}
{"text": "Rolling Stone wrote, \"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\" According to The New York Times, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country\u2014a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\u2014but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\" The Guardian wrote that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.\" Consequence pinpointed her \"capacity to continually reinvent while remaining herself\", while Time dubbed Swift a \"musical chameleon\" for the constantly evolving sound of her discography. Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.\n"}
{"text": "Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Her singing voice is \"sweet but soft\" according to Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter. Pitchfork's Sam Sodomsky called it \"versatile and expressive\". Music theory professor Alyssa Barna described the timbre of Swift's upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and her lower register \"full and dark\". The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy.\" In 2010, a writer from The Tennessean conceded that Swift was \"not the best technical singer\", but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got\". According to Swift, her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career, and she worked hard to improve it. She said she only feels nervous performing live \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals were \"fine\", but did not match those of her peers.\n"}
{"text": "Though Swift's singing ability received mixed reviews early in her career, she was praised for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune. Rolling Stone found her voice \"unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer\", while The Village Voice noted the improvement from her previously \"bland and muddled\" phrasing to her learning \"how to make words sound like what they mean\". In 2014, NPR Music described her singing as personal and conversational thanks to her \"exceptional gift for inflection\", but also suffered from a \"wobbly pitch and tight, nasal delivery\". Beginning with Folklore, she received better reviews for her vocals; Variety critic Andrew Barker noted the \"remarkable\" control she developed over her vocals, never allowing a \"flourish or a tricky run to compromise the clarity of a lyric\", while doing \"wonders within her register\" and \"exploring its further reaches\". Reviewing Fearless (Taylor's Version), The New York Times critic Lindsay Zoladz described her voice as stronger, more controlled, and deeper over time, discarding the nasal tone of her early vocals. Lucy Harbron of Clash opined that Swift's vocals have evolved \"into her own unique blend of country, pop and indie\".\n"}
{"text": "Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time and the best of her generation by various publications and organizations. She told The New Yorker in 2011 that she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\" Swift's personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate the complexities of life. Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody. On her first three studio albums, recurring themes were love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective. She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red, and embraced nostalgia and positivity after failed relationships on 1989. Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame, and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\". Besides romance, other themes in Swift's music include parent-child relationships, friendships, alienation, and self-awareness.\n"}
{"text": "Music critics often praise her self-written discography, especially her confessional narratives; they compliment her writing for its vivid details and emotional engagement, which were rare among pop artists. New York magazine argued that Swift was the first teenage artist who explicitly portrayed teenage experiences in her music. Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\". Although reviews of Swift are generally positive, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\". Because of her confessional narratives, tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of the songs with ex-lovers of Swift, a practice which New York magazine considered \"sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\". Aside from clues provided in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about song subjects specifically. In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Swift stated that the criticism on her songwriting\u2014critics interpreted her persona as a \"clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her\"\u2014was \"a little sexist\".\n"}
{"text": "\"I love songwriting so much because there's an element to it that is still really mysterious\u2014like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you're not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that's where craftsmanship comes in; that\u2019s where you have the opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft.\"\n"}
{"text": "On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives. Without referencing her personal life, she imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from the mental stress caused by tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry. In a feature for Rolling Stone, Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success: \"I always thought, 'That'll never track on pop radio,' but when I was making Folklore, I thought, 'If you take away all the parameters, what do you make?\" With the release of Evermore, Spin found Swift exploring \"exceedingly complex human emotions with precision and devastation\". Consequence stated her 2020 albums \"offered a chance for doubters to see Swift's songwriting power on full display, but the truth is that her pen has always been her sword\" and that her writing prowess took \"different forms\" as she transformed from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult.\"\n"}
{"text": "Swift's bridges have been underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs and earned her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from media outlets. Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\" than Swift. The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times. Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".\n"}
{"text": "Swift has collaborated with many different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She has her own production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., which is credited with producing music videos for singles such as \"Me!\". Swift developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White. In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"\n"}
{"text": "From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\u2014four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft. She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015. She produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016. While she continued to co-direct music videos with the Lover singles\u2014\"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch\u2014she ventured into sole direction with the videos for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction), \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\".\n"}
{"text": "Swift became a teen idol with her debut, and a pop icon following global fame. Journalists have written about her polite, \"open\" personality, \"willing to play along\" during the course of an interview. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post called Swift a \"media darling\" and \"a reporter's dream\". The Guardian attributed her disposition to her formative years in country music. The Hollywood Reporter described Swift as \"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\". While presenting her with an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, former First Lady Michelle Obama described Swift as an artist who \"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\"; Swift considers Obama to be a role model.\n"}

According to YouGov surveys, she ranked as the world's most admired female musician from 2019 to 2021. One of the most followed people on social media, Swift is known for her frequent and friendly interactions with her fans online, also delivering holiday gifts to them by mail and in person. She considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans, praising her relationship with her fans as \"the longest and best\" she has ever had. Swift is known for regularly incorporating easter eggs into her works and social media posts for fans to discover clues about forthcoming releases. Fawzia Khan of Elle attributes Swift's \"perennial\" success partly to her intimacy with fans.\n"}
{"text": "Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businessperson. According to marketing executive Matt B. Britton, her business acumen has helped her \"excel as an authentic personality who establishes direct connections with her audience\", \"touch as many people as possible\", and \"generate a kind of advocacy and excitement that no level of advertising could.\" Inc. described Swift as an \"incredible flywheel\" of social media buzz and virtual word-of-mouth. Describing her omnipresence, The Ringer writer Kate Knibbs said Swift is not just a pop act but \"a musical biosphere unto herself\", having achieved the kind of success \"that turns a person into an institution, into an inevitability.\"\n"}
{"text": "Though Swift is reluctant to publicly discuss her personal life\u2014believing it to be \"a career weakness\"\u2014it is a topic of widespread media attention and tabloid speculation. Clash described her as a lightning rod for both praise and criticism. While The New York Times asserted in 2013 that Swift's \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether she was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\",  certain critics have highlighted the misogyny and slut-shaming Swift's life and career have been subject to. She parodied this scrutiny in \"Blank Space\".[note 5] Rolling Stone said, after the release of 1989, \"everything she did was a story\", with a non-stop news cycle about her, leaving her overexposed. Much of Reputation was conceived under the \"intense\" media scrutiny she experienced in 2015 and 2016, causing her to adopt a dark, defensive alter ego on the album.  She criticized sexist double standards and gaslighting in \"The Man\" (2019) and \"Mad Woman\" (2020), respectively. When asked \"why sing to the haters?\" by CBS journalist Tracy Smith, Swift replied, \"well, when they stop coming for me, I will stop singing to them.\" Glamour opined Swift is an easy target for male derision and triggers \"fragile male egos\" to take \"pot-shots\" at her career.  The Daily Telegraph said her antennae for sexism is crucial for the industry and that she \"must continue holding people to account\".\n"}
{"text": "Swift's fashion is often covered by media outlets, with her street style receiving acclaim. Her fashion appeal has been picked up by several media publications, such as People, Elle, Vogue, and Maxim. Vogue regards Swift as one of the world's most influential figures in sustainable fashion. Elle highlighted the various styles she has adopted throughout her career, including the \"curly-haired teenager\" of her early days to \"red-lipped pop bombshell\" with \"platinum blonde hair and sultry makeup looks\" later on. Swift is known for reinventing her image often, corresponding each one of her albums to a specific aesthetic. Swift also popularized cottagecore with Folklore and Evermore. Consequence opined that Swift's looks evolved from \"girl-next-door country act to pop star to woodsy poet over a decade.\"\n"}
{"text": "Though labeled by the media as \"America's Sweetheart\", a sobriquet based on her down-to-earth personality and girl-next-door image, Swift insists she does not \"live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\". Although she refused to take part in \"sexy\" photoshoots in 2012, she stated \"it's nice to be glamorous\" in 2015. Bloomberg views Swift as a sex symbol, albeit of a subtle and sophisticated variety unlike many of her female contemporaries.\n"}
{"text": "\nSwift's career helped shape the modern country music scene. According to music journalist Jody Rosen, Swift is the first country artist whose fame reached the world beyond the U.S. Her chart success extended to Asia and the U.K., where country music had previously not been popular. She is recognized as one of the first country artists to use technology and viral marketing techniques, such as MySpace, to promote their work. According to Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly, the commercial success of her debut album helped the infant Big Machine Records go on to sign Garth Brooks and Jewel. Following Swift's rise to fame, country labels became more interested in signing young singers who write their own music. With her autobiographical narratives revolving around romance and heartbreak, she introduced the genre to a younger generation that could relate to her personally. Critics have since noted the impact of Swift's sound on various albums released by female country singers such as Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini. Rolling Stone listed her country music as one of the biggest influences on 2010s pop music and ranked her 80th in their list of 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time."}

Pitchfork opined that Swift changed the contemporary music landscape forever with her \"unprecedented path from teenage country prodigy to global pop sensation\" and a \"singularly perceptive\" discography that consistently accommodates both musical and cultural shifts. Clash stated Swift's genre-spanning career encouraged her peers to experiment with diverse sounds. Billboard credited her with influencing artists to take creative ownership of their music and remarked she \"has the power to pull any sound she wants into mainstream orbit.\" Music journalist Nick Catucci wrote that, in being personal and vulnerable in her lyrics, Swift helped make space for later pop stars like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same. According to The Guardian, Swift leads the rebirth of poptimism in the 21st-century with her ambitious artistic vision.\n"}
{"text": "Publications consider Swift's million-selling albums an anomaly in the streaming-dominated music industry following the decline of the album era in the 2010s. For this reason, musicologists Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold regard her as \"the last great rock star\". Swift is the only artist to have four albums sell over one million copies in one week since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for the Billboard 200 in 1991. To New York magazine, her million sales figures prove that she is \"the one bending the music industry to her will\". The Atlantic notes that Swift's \"reign\" defies the convention that the successful phase of an artist's career rarely lasts more than a few years. She is a champion of independent record shops, having contributed to the 21st-century vinyl revival and been labelled by some publications as \"Vinyl Queen\". Journalists note how her actions have fostered debate over reforms to on-demand music streaming and prompted awareness of intellectual property rights among younger musicians, praising her ability to bring change in the music industry.\n"}

Swift has influenced various mainstream and indie recording artists.[note 6] Various sources deem her music to be representative and paradigmatic of the millennial generation, owing to her success, musical versatility, social media presence, live shows, and corporate sponsorship. Vox called Swift the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\" for telling the stories of a generation through her songs. Student societies focusing on her were established in various universities around the world, such as Oxford, York, and Cambridge.
